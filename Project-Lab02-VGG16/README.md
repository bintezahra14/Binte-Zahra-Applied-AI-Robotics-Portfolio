# Lab 02 – VGG16 No-Code Deep Learning Lab

**Course:** ITAI 2376 – Deep Learning  

In this lab, I interacted with the **pre-trained VGG16** model on ImageNet using a no-code / low-code Colab notebook:

- Loaded VGG16 with pretrained weights  
- Preprocessed images to 224×224 RGB + `preprocess_input`  
- Ran predictions and viewed top-k labels  
- Observed how rotations, crops, blur, and brightness changes affect predictions :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}  

## File

- `ITAI2376_BinteZahra_L02.ipynb - Colab.pdf` – notebook printout (code + results)

## What I Learned

- Importance of correct preprocessing for pretrained models  
- How sensitive models can be to viewpoint, noise, and image quality
