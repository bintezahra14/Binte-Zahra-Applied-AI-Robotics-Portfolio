# A05 – Arrival (2016) and NLP: Communication Challenges

**Course:** ITAI 2376 – Deep Learning / NLP  

Using the film **Arrival (2016)**, this project explores key **NLP challenges**:

- Semantic ambiguity (e.g., misinterpretation of the word “weapon”)  
- Non-linear written language like Heptapod logograms  
- Unsupervised learning: Dr. Louise Banks learning language from unlabeled examples  
- Cultural bias and different worldviews as analogs to multilingual / cross-domain NLP :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
