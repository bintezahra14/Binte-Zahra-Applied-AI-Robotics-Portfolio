# A02 – TensorFlow vs PyTorch: Comparative Brief

**Course:** ITAI 2376 – Deep Learning  

This short paper compares **TensorFlow** and **PyTorch** as deep learning frameworks, focusing on:

- Ecosystem and tooling (Keras, TensorBoard, TFX, TF-Serving, TF-Lite / TF.js)
- Flexibility and dynamic computation graphs in PyTorch
- Production vs research strengths
- Real-world examples like Google Translate, Airbnb search, Hugging Face, and Tesla Autopilot :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## What I Learned

- When to choose TensorFlow (end-to-end production pipelines)
- When to use PyTorch (fast research, flexible experimentation)
- Why both are important in modern AI workflows
