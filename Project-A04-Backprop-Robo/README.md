# A04 – Backpropagation: Robo’s Basketball Adventure

**Course:** ITAI 2376 – Deep Learning  

A kid-friendly story explaining **backpropagation** with a robot called **Robo** learning to shoot a basketball:

- Robo sees the hoop (input layer), thinks (hidden layer), and throws (output layer)
- When he misses, an **error signal** is sent backward
- Each neuron adjusts its **weights** like “volume knobs” to improve the next shot :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}  

The presentation connects this to real AI systems (face recognition, self-driving, recommendations).
