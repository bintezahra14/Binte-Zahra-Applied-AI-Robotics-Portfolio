# A03 – Neural Network Zoo: GAN Butterfly

**Course:** ITAI 2376 – Deep Learning  

This presentation explains **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** using the metaphor of a **“GAN Butterfly”**:

- **Generator wing (Artist):** creates fake images from random noise  
- **Discriminator wing (Critic):** tells real vs fake images  
- Both improve together through an adversarial game  
- Metamorphosis from random noise → blurry images → realistic outputs :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}  

It also shows applications like:

- **ThisPersonDoesNotExist.com** (fake faces)  
- **CycleGAN** style transfer  
- **Pix2Pix** paired image-to-image translation

## What I Learned

- Intuition for how GANs train through competition  
- How generative models are used in art, data synthesis, and synthetic media
